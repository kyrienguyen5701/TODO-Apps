# Self notes

- Both Flask and FastAPI don't take much time for setting up and can be used for small applications. FastAPI seems to be slightly more robust than Flask in this demo. On the other hand, Django is a full-stack modularized framework and has a lot of convenient built-in utilities (in this demo, the admin portal and the database), making it suitable for complex applications.
